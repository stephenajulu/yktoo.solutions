A short announcement.

On **20 September** I will be presenting at [IDM Europe](https://whitehallmedia.co.uk/idmeuropesep2018/) about two most popular open-source identity servers: [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) and [WSO₂ IS](https://wso2.com/identity-and-access-management/), exploring their functionality and differences.

The conference will be held at the [Postillion Convention Center](https://www.postillionhotels.com/en-gb/conferenties-events/amsterdam) in Amsterdam, and my presentation is scheduled at **14:35**. Feel free to drop by should you happen to be in the area; there's a [whole lot more](https://whitehallmedia.co.uk/idmeuropesep2018/programme/) to learn (but don't forget to [register](https://whitehallmedia.co.uk/idmeuropesep2018/registration) first).
